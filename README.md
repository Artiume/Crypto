How to Mine and its different aspects

Pools

In order to Mine, you either have to Mine by yourself or in a Pool. It is near impossible to Mine solo these days and everybody participate in Pools.

Here's a graph of the different Pools for Bitcoin

I currently use [ethermine](ethermine.org) as my pool.

I have used [nanopool](https://www.nanopool.org/) in the past.

Hardware

There are some services called Mining Rig Rentals (MRR's), you can rent equipment that's probably placed in a data center somewhere. I'm not really interested in any of these services.

While I have chosen to focus on Mining Ethereum, it can be more or less efficient to mine other types of coins. Here's a chart showing the different coins and their profitability. I haven't gotten into this type of testing yet. One thing that this chart doesn't include is the Power Usage.

There is also the comparison of the different Mining Software. I currently use [nsfminer](https://github.com/no-fee-ethereum-mining/nsfminer).

Crypto Currency Comparisons

Each cryptocurrency secures its network with some form of consensus. With [Bitcoin](https://www.blockchain.com/explorer) and [Ethereum](https://etherscan.io/chart/blocktime), they use Proof-of-Work, this is the most known form of Mining. Hardware attempts to solve a puzzle that on average will take an average of X minutes. For Bitcoin, this is every 10 minutes. Ethereum is roughly every 13 seconds.
