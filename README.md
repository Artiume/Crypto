How to Mine and its different aspects

Pools

In order to Mine, you either have to Mine by yourself or in a Pool. It is near impossible to Mine solo these days and everybody participate in Pools.


Here's a graph of the different Pools for Bitcoin

I currently use ethermine.org as my pool

I have used nanopool in the past.

Hardware

There are some services called Mining Rig Rentals (MRR's), you can rent equipment that's probably placed in a data center somewhere. I'm not really interested in any of these services.

While I have chosen to focus on Mining Ethereum, it can be more or less efficient to mine other types of coins. Here's a chart showing the different coins and their profitability. I haven't gotten into this type of testing yet. One thing that this chart doesn't include is the Power Usage.
