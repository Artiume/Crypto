# Crypto

## How to start

The first step is to create a wallet. This is similar to creating a bank account. There are two types of wallets; hot wallets and cold wallets. A hot wallet is the term for a digital wallet or one that is on your phone or computer. Using a software wallet such as [MyEtherWallet (MEW)](https://www.myetherwallet.com/) or [Metamask](https://metamask.io/), here's a [comparison](https://cryptogeek.info/en/compare-wallets/metamask-vs-myetherwallet) of the two. These are Ethereum based wallets. For different cryptos, different apps would be necessary.

### Creating a hot wallet

First install MetaMask either as a phone app or browser plugin. Once ready, open the app and click Get Started then Create a new wallet. It'll ask you for a unique password. Next, it'll ask to Secure Your Wallet by creating a Secret Pass Phrase. This is a 12 word code that will recover your wallet in the event that you lose your password. Your unique password actually doesn't matter, the 12 word Pass Phrase is the real password to your wallet. Write it down on paper and place it in a safe because it can be used to recover or steal your wallet. 

### Your First Wallet

Now that you're logged into Metamask, you can see a few options to Send, Recieve or Swap. This is just like a bank account in that you can send or receive money. The Swap option is to convert your Ethereum into a token. These are similar to foreign currencies. Swapping Ethereum for a token can be expensive with high network fees and it may be cheaper to use an exchange to buy the currencies directly rather than Swapping them yourself using your private wallet.

### Sending and Recieving Money

In order to send money, you're required to use your Private Key. Key is synonymous with address, so a public address and public key mean the same thing. Metamask does this behind the scenes so you don't have to worry about it. When receiving money, you just need to provide your public address. All public addresses are public. They are visible to everyone in the world and are relatively safe to share. People these days will post their public keys on their websites similar for people to tip them, similar to [Patreon](https://support.patreon.com/hc/en-us/articles/204606315-What-is-Patreon-). Never share your Private Key, if your secret pass phrase or private key is compromised, the wallet is considered Burned and shouldn't be used.

### Cold Wallets

A [cold wallet](https://www.bitdegree.org/crypto/cold-wallet) uses a physical key similar to a USB drive to secure your wallet. A cold wallet cannot be opened without the hardware key so it's impenetrable but can also be lost or stolen. They cost roughly $100 online, but are the most secure way to protect your crypto, you could literally bury your money.

### Exchanges

In order to convert to crypto or to cash, an Exchange is required. They are finance institutions similar to banks and have Know Your Customer rules such as ID and SSN. Some Exchanges such as [CoinBase](https://coinbase.com/) will give you your public and private keys in order to control your wallets. Other exchanges such as [eToro](https://www.etoro.com/en-us/) allow you open a spread against a cryptocurrency similar to a stock. Exchanges such as eToro are frowned upon because you are unable to control the crypto wallet, you have to trust eToro to ensure your money is safe. Coinbase provides a flat fee of $3 per $100. [eToro's Fees](https://www.etoro.com/trading/fees/) is based on a small % of the spread so it can fluctaute between a small fee to a high fee.

Some services such as [MoonPay](https://www.moonpay.com/) will let you use VISA to buy crypto using your debit card. These can be used in conjunction with metamask or MEW to buy more crypto without needing an exchange. MoonPay has Know Your Customer rules as well. 

## How to Mine

Each cryptocurrency secures its network with some form of consensus. With [Bitcoin](https://www.blockchain.com/explorer) and [Ethereum](https://etherscan.io/chart/blocktime), they use Proof-of-Work, this is the most known form of Mining. Hardware attempts to solve a puzzle that on average will take an average of X minutes. For Bitcoin, this is every 10 minutes. Ethereum is roughly every 13 seconds. Proof-of-Staking is the second most popular form of mining. It is similar to a savings account, in that, you hold crypto in your wallet and you get APY dividends. Some pay out daily, some weekly. The interest rate is typically between 4% and 6%.

### Hardware

Proof-of-Work Mining requires you to use either your computer's processor (CPU), graphics card (GPU), or an [ASIC](https://www.sigenics.com/blog/what-is-an-asic). We will be focusing on GPU mining since it is the most flexible in terms of price, setup and knowledge.

Setting up a miner is similar to any other computer, it needs a power supply, motherboard and frame. There are [solutions](https://www.newegg.com/p/2AM-041K-00001?Description=mining%20rig&cm_re=mining_rig-_-9SIAG4BEDP9010-_-Product&quicklink=true) that allow you to buy ready to use rigs that just need GPU's to be installed. For large scale operations, these might need the best way to go since they save a lot of time. Building a rig from stratch can take days.

#### ASICs

ASICs are highly specialized, and very expensive equipment. Fake sites are found online all the time so it's hard to find a dealer who isn't a scammer.

[This one](https://bitmainasic.com/product/antminer-e9/) is a scam while [this one](https://shop.bitmain.com/product/detail?pid=00020210906093828676yFf2Be5J0682) should be safe.

[Website Scammer Checker](https://www.scamvoid.net/check/bitmain.com/)

Because of their high cost and possible chance of scams, I'm hesitant to delve into them though they would be higher profits and installation time is zero. More downsides to using ASICs are that they cannot be upgraded. Once they become dated, their value drops dramatically and can be hard to resell since their functionality is obsolete whereas GPUs are a lot more flexible and are better at retaining their value and are easier to resell.

Pools

In order to Mine, you either have to Mine by yourself or in a Pool. It is near impossible to Mine solo these days and everybody participate in Pools.

Here's a graph of the different Pools for Bitcoin

I currently use [ethermine](ethermine.org) as my pool.

I have used [nanopool](https://www.nanopool.org/) in the past.

Hardware

There are some services called Mining Rig Rentals (MRR's), you can rent equipment that's probably placed in a data center somewhere. I'm not really interested in any of these services.

While I have chosen to focus on Mining Ethereum, it can be more or less efficient to mine other types of coins. Here's a chart showing the different coins and their profitability. I haven't gotten into this type of testing yet. One thing that this chart doesn't include is the Power Usage.

There is also the comparison of the different Mining Software. I currently use [nsfminer](https://github.com/no-fee-ethereum-mining/nsfminer).
