# Crypto

## How to start

The first step is to create a wallet. This is similar to creating a bank account. There are two types of wallets; hot wallets and cold wallets. A hot wallet is the term for a digital wallet or one that is on your phone or computer. Using a software wallet such as [MyEtherWallet (MEW)](https://www.myetherwallet.com/) or [Metamask](https://metamask.io/), here's a [comparison](https://cryptogeek.info/en/compare-wallets/metamask-vs-myetherwallet) of the two.

### Creating a hot wallet

First install 

### Cold Wallets

A [cold wallet](https://www.bitdegree.org/crypto/cold-wallet) uses a physical key similar to a USB drive to secure your wallet. A cold wallet cannot be opened without the hardware key so it's impenetrable but can also be lost or stolen. They cost roughly $100 online, but are the most secure way to protect your crypto, you could literally bury your money.

### Exchanges

In order to convert to crypto or to cash, an Exchange is required. Some services such as [MoonPay](https://www.moonpay.com/) will let you use VISA to buy crypto using your debit card. Some Exchanges such as [CoinBase](https://coinbase.com/) will give you your public and private keys in order to control your wallets. Other exchanges such as [eToro](https://www.etoro.com/en-us/) allow you open a spread against a cryptocurrency similar to a stock. Exchanges such as eToro are frowned upon because you are unable to control the crypto wallet, you have to trust eToro to ensure your money is safe. Coinbase provides a flat fee of $3 per $100. [eToro's Fees](https://www.etoro.com/trading/fees/) is based on a small % of the spread so it can fluctaute between a small fee to a high fee.

## How to Mine

### Hardware

Pools

In order to Mine, you either have to Mine by yourself or in a Pool. It is near impossible to Mine solo these days and everybody participate in Pools.

Here's a graph of the different Pools for Bitcoin

I currently use [ethermine](ethermine.org) as my pool.

I have used [nanopool](https://www.nanopool.org/) in the past.

Hardware

There are some services called Mining Rig Rentals (MRR's), you can rent equipment that's probably placed in a data center somewhere. I'm not really interested in any of these services.

While I have chosen to focus on Mining Ethereum, it can be more or less efficient to mine other types of coins. Here's a chart showing the different coins and their profitability. I haven't gotten into this type of testing yet. One thing that this chart doesn't include is the Power Usage.

There is also the comparison of the different Mining Software. I currently use [nsfminer](https://github.com/no-fee-ethereum-mining/nsfminer).

## Crypto Currency Comparisons

Each cryptocurrency secures its network with some form of consensus. With [Bitcoin](https://www.blockchain.com/explorer) and [Ethereum](https://etherscan.io/chart/blocktime), they use Proof-of-Work, this is the most known form of Mining. Hardware attempts to solve a puzzle that on average will take an average of X minutes. For Bitcoin, this is every 10 minutes. Ethereum is roughly every 13 seconds.
